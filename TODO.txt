- Add output to explain next steps after "shanty init"
- Use repo name as project name by default
- Extract all options from template files, move to default template files
  - Search user's config files for overrides on any default configs
  - Add documentation for all allowed config values
- Build a template/skeleton feature where a user could provide via the
  commandline a URL to a template/skeleton to use to aid in getting sane
  default config values for their environment. For example reachlocal could
  have one and that could have all the defaults for RLPC minus the username,
  password stuff.
- Add shanty lint functionality that verifies the required .shanty.yml config
  exists, the provider config exists, and that the required fields in those
  configs exist are have valid values.
- Add --provider=aws as an optional option to the `shanty init` command. That
  way it can generate different provider_configs for the different providers.
