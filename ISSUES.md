is still appreciated.

If you are unable to do that, please include the following information in your
report:

 - The command you ran
 - What you expected to happen
 - What actually happened
 - The exception backtrace(s), if any
 - What version of BoxCI you are using (run `boxci --verson`)
 - What version of Ruby you are using (run `ruby -v`)

[Create a gist](https://gist.github.com) containing all of that information,
then visit the [BoxCI issue
tracker](https://github.com/reachlocal/boxci/issues) and [create a
ticket](https://github.com/reachlocal/boxci/issues/new) describing your
